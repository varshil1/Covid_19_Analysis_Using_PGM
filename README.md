# Covid_19_Analysis_Using_PGM

A novel corona virus that causes COVID-19, the respiratory disease responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2. 
The pandemic not only sparked the biggest health crisis of the 21st century so far, but it also induced a global economic recession. 
We still know very little about this virus to this day, but how it transmits, 
we do know that the most susceptible population is elderly people and people with pre-existing conditions, 
but there are few studies carried out to measure risks associate with a specific age or condition. This project tries to quantify and estimate risks to infectious COVID-19 based on the pre-existing conditions and age groups. 
The analysis is carried out using principles of such as Bayesian network model from Probabilistic graphical models.
